# Force-Directed Graph Visualization with D3.js

This project implements a **force-directed layout graph** using D3.js to visualize relationships between nodes in a graph. The force-directed layout algorithm uses attractive and repulsive forces to position nodes in a more visually appearing way.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualization**: Nodes and edges can be manipulated dynamically.
- **Automatic Layout**: The force-directed algorithm arranges nodes to minimize overlap and edge crossings, creating a clearer visual.
- **Customizable Design**: Easily adjust colors, sizes, and forces to fit the needs of different datasets.

## Benefits of Force-Directed Layout Graphs

Force-directed layouts are highly effective for visualizing relationships in data because they create an organic, readable arrangement of nodes that reveals important structural information. By positioning connected nodes closer together, the layout naturally highlights clusters, patterns, and central nodes, making it easier to interpret complex networks.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the graph.
3. Customize the graph parameters in `script.js` to fit your data.

## Dependencies

- [D3.js](https://d3js.org/)
